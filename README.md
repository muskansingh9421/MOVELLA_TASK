# MOVELLA ASSIGNMENT
  
## Prerequisites

Running `python file` requires:

* Python 3.7 (tested under Python 3.7.5)
* futher need to have `re`
```
  pip install re
```

## Coding Guidelines

1. All your Python resides in root.  
2. The SQL file is also located in root.

## Assignment
1. Write a command line program that simulates checking password strength based on certain rules.
2. Write a program that accepts a log file and writes 3 different log files - one
for each type of log entry ( i.e. INFO log, DEBUG log and ERROR logs) containing those relevant type
of log entries.
3. SQL QUERIES

## Instructions 
1. To Run the python files 
    ```
    $ python3 passwordChecker.py
    ```
    same procedure for `fileparsing.py`
2. The output files are already in the repository to test the program you can delete output file (DEBUFlog.txt,INFOlog.txt & ERRORlog.txt)
3. You can also use your own log file but it should be copied into the root directory

## Unit Test Cases

### Password checker
    ```
    python3 passwordChecker.py
    >>> Enter Your Password =xyz123
        Password Strength AVERAGE
        Password should have atleast 8 characters
        Password should contains atleast 2 special characters

    python3 passwordChecker.py
    >>> Enter Your Password =muskan@123%
        Password Strength VERY GOOD

    python3 passwordChecker.py
    >>> Enter Your Password =xyz
        Password Strength LOW
        Password should have atleast 8 characters
        Password should contains atleast 2 special characters
    
    ```
### File Parsing
    ```
    python3 fileParsing.py
    >>>Enter filename :xyz
    File Doesnt Exist

    python3 fileParsing.py
    >>>Enter filename :
    Filename should not be Blank

    python3 fileParsing.py
    >>>Enter filename :log.txt  // will create file with required data
    Process Done!
    
    ```
